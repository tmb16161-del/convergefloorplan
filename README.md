   2. SEATING LIST  — paste from your spreadsheet between the backticks.

   One guest per line. Copy two columns straight out of Excel or Sheets
   (Name, Table) and paste — the tab between them is handled automatically.
   A comma works too: the text after the LAST comma is read as the table,
   so "Smith, Jane, 4" still works.
   An optional third tab-separated column is shown under the guest's name.

        Jane Smith      4       University of Glasgow
        Ahmed Khan      4
        Smith, Jane, 12

   Leave it empty and the seat finder shows a "coming soon" message,
